# General
- Use descriptive names for everything. No one likes `var a1`.
- Readability > Cleverness.
- Stay consistent.
- Seperation of concerns: each function should do _one_ thing and do it well.
- Good code comments itself.
- Remove unnecessary/unused code and imports.
- If you're unsure of something, don't be scared ask your peers. We're here to help.
- Write code that a human can understand, not just the interpreter.
- DRY (don't repeat yourself).
- KISS (keep it simple, stupid).
